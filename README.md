# PyExplorReg

Py/ExplorReg presents a novel tool tailored for delving into transcriptomic landscapes and uncovering regulon structures, focusing notably on its utility in the context of Arabidopsis thaliana research. Developed using Python, Py/ExplorReg demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying regulons through a pioneering approach rooted in the analysis of gene expression data. Leveraging publicly available datasets from the EMBL-EBI project PRJNA779072, this tool underscores its adaptability to Arabidopsis thaliana datasets. Py/ExplorReg marks a significant advancement in unraveling regulon architectures and enhancing our understanding of gene regulatory networks, serving as a valuable asset for molecular biology investigations.
